This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Phase 1: The Business Model
For an interview copilot, you have two highly effective pricing strategies:

1. The "Pay-Per-Interview" Model (Recommended for launch)
   • How it works: Users buy "credits." $5 gets you 2 hours of interview time.
   • Why it works: Job hunting is temporary. People might not want a monthly subscription if they only have three interviews this week.
   • The Math: Deepgram and Groq cost you roughly $0.20 to $0.30 per hour of live processing. If you charge $5 for 2 hours, your profit margin is over 80%.
2. The "Pro Subscription" Model
   • How it works: $15/month for unlimited interviews, saving chat histories, and advanced AI models (like allowing them to choose a harsher/stricter AI persona).
   • Why it works: Predictable recurring revenue for you while they are actively job hunting.
